- Offer a web-based spectrum viewer (Dash/Panel) as an alternative to the Tk GUI for headless remote use.

- Publish SNR/quality metrics post-run to help users compare decoder configurations.


  * Capture benchmarking harness (CLI flag + synthetic captures) so future LLM-assisted changes can validate throughput regressions automatically.






  Something is up with our progress bar. While it does update I saw it get to 2% I then got completed (this was on the preview path I should add) and trhe file was generated but our preview box stayed there and when I closed it it closed the whole app.
  Also, we should add a box to select a destination for the outputs right now they're saved in the same place as the source location but users might want a different destination for the processed files (both previews and final processing both can go to the same output dir)
